          <h3>Spider Man</h3>

          <h3>Thor</h3>
          <p>Nordic legend tells the tale of the son of Odin, the heir to the throne of Asgard - he is THOR, renowned as the mightiest hero of mythology! Thor's strength, endurance, and quest for battle are far greater than his Asgardian brethren. The mighty Thor wields an enchanted Uru hammer, Mjolnir, and is master of thunder and lightning.</p>

            <h3>Ironman</h3>
            <p>When billionaire industrialist Tony Stark dons his sophisticated steel-mesh armor, he becomes a living high-tech weapon - the world's greatest fighting machine. Tony has primed his ultra modern creation for waging state of the art campaigns, attaining sonic flight, and defending the greater good! He is the Armored Avenger - driven by a heart that is part machine, but all hero! He is the INVINCIBLE IRON MAN!</p>

          <h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
          <p>Distinguished neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange's self-important worldview was shattered, along with his steady operating hands, in a fateful car accident. Desperate to heal his injuries and pride, Strange sought out a legendary safe known as the Ancient One, becoming a pupil of the mystic arts. Learning that his true worth had always come from within, Strange uncovered his full potential and was chosen to become the Sorcerer Supreme, the world's pre-eminent defender against the darkness that lurks beyond.</p>

          <h3>Hulk</h3>
          <p>A massive dose of gamma radiation transformed the brilliant but meek scientist Bruce Banner's DNA, awakening the hidden, adrenaline-fed hero in his genes... HULK! A hero of few words and incredible strength, the Hulk has long been pursued by those who want to use his immense power for their own purposes, or by those who thought the Jade Giant's anger was too dangerous to be controlled. Now, as a member of the Avengers, Hulk helps smash the unimaginable threats that no Hero could face alone, hoping to at least prove to the world that he is the strongest HERO there is!</p>
